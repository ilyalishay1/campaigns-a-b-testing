Project Goal

Analyze the performance of two campaigns (control and test) based on the provided dataset. The primary objective is to determine which campaign delivers better results across key metrics.

Project Steps

Preliminary Data Processing.
Load and study the dataset structure.
Handle any missing values if present.
Standardize data formats (e.g., dates).
Check for outliers and correct them.

Calculation of Key Metrics

For each campaign, calculate:
Average and median expenditure (Spend).
Average impressions (Impressions), unique impressions (Reach), and website clicks (Website Clicks).
Calculate cost per purchase.
Conversion rates for each stage:
Conversion from impressions (Impressions) to website clicks (Website Clicks).
Conversion from clicks to content views (View Content).
Conversion from cart additions (Add to Cart) to purchases (Purchase).
Conversion from website clicks to purchases.

Comparative Analysis of Campaigns

Compare the results of the control and test campaigns across key metrics (e.g., cost per acquisition, conversion rate from website clicks to purchases).
Identify strengths and weaknesses of each campaign.

Statistical Testing

Conduct an appropriate test to determine the statistical significance of differences between the campaigns.
Evaluate the p-value and decide if the differences are significant.

Power Analysis

Verify if the data is sufficient to draw reliable conclusions.
Assess whether the test duration was adequate.

Data Visualization

Create charts to present results:
Compare expenditures, impressions, clicks, and conversions.
Visualize changes across funnel stages.

Project Results

Conclusions about statistically significant differences between the campaigns.
Recommendations for marketing strategy.
